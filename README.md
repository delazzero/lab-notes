Q: talk goals, strategize how to maximize yield from the course/direct my approach; ways I can supplement requirements with more

Broad Digital humanities:

First Piller: Comp cultural studies
•	Methodology: Computational cultural studies: 
o	Quantitative approach to study literature… goes back to x? century. 
o	Traditionally humanities have not been doing this; but now return to that idea. In journalism, interest in telling stories with data. They release huge amts of information and receive gigabytes of data…what do you do with that? How do you find a story within large corpus of data?
	Have corpus
	Trying to find patterns
•	Thematic: Study of computational culture
o	Whole new phenomena and themes
	History of computing, interfaces: who invented that? 
	Applied: can we think of ways to improve—not from tech view—looking at fundamental human experience and thinking of how to make it better. There is need for people in tech to think culturally.

Second pillar: knowledge design/ knowledge architecture 
•	What is it? Book chapters. What is history of diving books into chapters. Cognitive scaffolding surrounds us. Search box on a PDF. 
•	How we shape/hang knowledge/ phil of education of knowledge
o	Books
o	Library, classroom, libraries, fonts has knowledge design
•	Often done without our knowledge or consent; we aren’t asked if we would like to structure our discuss by this class; we need to do more in thinking about these structures
•	If take this seriously (access of security guard, public/priv distinction)—knowledge should happen with our involvement and we need to look and take more active participatory role with institution
•	Few people take furnishings seriously; critically reflect on these things
•	Need to take same care of reading texts to physical architecture.
•	We are going to read artifacts, interfaces and interrogate critically
•	Not what we can fit under rubric, but how apply to something specific
•	Weird space between art and science
o	Very few histories of data visualization—hard core sya not science but interpretation/propaganda (Nazis, no numbers);who will write history of bar graph
•	We---careful with these pronouns, media scholars---is tree or content knowledge design? Analyzing design slightly different than knowedge design
o	Turn toward physical/material properties of content
	Study photos but can you do that w/o knowledge of photoshop; unless you have that emphasis of physical properties, …materials …how representations are made anthropologically. That is more knowledge design than “representation of bodies in comptemporary photography”
	Archives another example
	Take content and create interfaces
•	Think of ways to structure interfaces

Third Pillar of digital humanities: attention to material context of knowledge production (e.g.) and changing conditions
•	Education/MOOCS, Code Academy; what are we going to do with library, what are economics of publishing, what will this do to our prospects; how traditional responds to disruption; tech enables you to bypass publisher …material conditions of content…how to take notes
•	If you don’t think/suggest/go out/participate in creating future, it will be created for you. Think about implications of restructuring knowledge; if we don’t take critical charge, it will be taken care of for us.
o	Need vocab and expertise to reflect and contribute

Component of info exchange (hospital=library)
Operating systems as type of text

Teaching philosophy:
•	Hate grading and busy work
•	Grades are mechanical; not a writing class. Assignments will check whether you’re reading the material.
•	Text first: seriously read first/talk about text first…on this text, not as much of a canon. 
•	Courseworks, piazza site; always check digital, online version
•	Post in few sentences or paragraphs. Community moderation: answer other people’s post; 
•	Annotated lab notebooks
o	Mondays read and talk
	Forum feeds into discussion
o	Wednesdays: meet in library butler 208b and have workshop
	During workshop; take notes; making wiki for yourself; with time, those notes might become more formal… become tutorial for journalists or githubs. “My notes become published wikis for others’. Write down what you learn: questions, shortcuts
•	Notebook feeds into practice; documents feed into practice
•	Midterm: passage IDs. Read and get it. Really reward people who do regular reading.
•	Final: same, mechanical
•	Buy D is for Digital
•	Post: off cuff, informal; 

Tenen—9/9

•	Develop a new language/vocabulary
•	Intervention
•	Tradition: Marxism, materialism
•	Marx: base and superstructure
o	Fruedan picture has similar shape (id/base and ego/superstructure)
o	Determines our every day interactions with each other
o	Base is relations of production; what is the base?—who is paying the bills, what kind of contract 
o	Everything else is located in superstructure (legal, political, art, philosophy)
o	Constistutes real foundation 
o	Talkingabout consciousness not just as brain structure—as a shared structure—everything, anything ideas, shared thru acculturation
o	Marxist view of materialism: took the material to be the primary one. 
o	Part of what’s confusing is how bread finds its way to the table from the factory; we will examine the passage of writing of text…in looking at that passageway…how did those words come into your hands
o	Material way is to find how who printer is, who translated the text, who controls that paper, who controls the distribution
o	Not big but little ways of protest: insert into process of making text; how to activiely be a part of the material process
o	When we talk about reistance/compliance, we operate on superstructure (words, ideas). Traditional Marxist would say it doesn’t matter….to effect change you have to effect on level of production
o	Whenever you see transofmration of ideas, but underneath are new ways of working, buying
o	Base is spirit, movement; writing Is in the superstructure
o	Marx’s project has run its course….why has it run its course? Communism…in studying texts, culture, you will see dead ends in thought
•	Freud: hidden vs exposed
•	Sharon marcus’s surface reading
o	Privledged position of analyst/authorial position
o	What gives you that authority; why aren’t you just another cog
•	Two crique’s of Marxism: 
o	1) you write books but you don’t know how books are made; what does it say about you as a Marxist who doesn’t know about typesetting being outsourced? Where is course that exposes that system that undermines distribution of knowledge that we use every day; you proport to be materialist but just attend to words instead of maeriliaty
o	2) surface/depth: just a distraction, gives something to do
o	maker magazine/movement/culture: do it yourself

Heideggar
•	“free relationship” (p.3) first page of essay
•	technology and its relationship to freedom
•	how instruments help us construct our world
•	colors, limited to senses
•	enframing—technology is sensory tool, truths about the world, with each instrument it blooms into a whole world view
•	world come through and human come through (p 11)
•	instrument, tech reveals truth
•	enframing danger/standing reserve: instead of hammer  revealing something else, everything becomes hammer including you
•	instead of having wonderful different frames and freedom to choose, destruvtively or constructively 
•	standing reserve/shortcircuiting…not getting to some truth..spiraling into closed systems
•	heid: ordering is phenomenological
Winner: 
•	tech is way of ordering the world, but ordering is political
•	tech usually described in instrumental terms 
•	purpose is to see our tools/recover. On Wednesday I’m going to try to convince you to write in a different way

9/17
•	tackle fundamental concepts theoretically, and get a tactile feel
•	sontag: distinction between content and theme
•	grounding, foundational, critical practice so that you can make decision about what tools to use. That decision has implications for practical reasons but also have a political implication 
•	has political and phenemological implications (not just janitorial work)
•	for heiddegar and winner, way to form the word around you
•	how you enframe this world….not just extension of hand but also brain
•	pen and computer no longer barrier…extension of body
•	talk more about texts and how texts work
•	outline managerial problem
o	how do I organize my files
o	everything starts on level of operating system
o	local/global imbalance of access to knowledge
o	superstructural pehnome have at root base (level of production)
o	viualize the pathways (finger to computer…we can visualize) and your compytutr to way it reaches your readers and texts
•	I propose:
o	We think of docs as points; think instead as lines and vectors (your brain to another brain). Doc is not just point, one thing, it travels in space…when you publish something it moves through electrons and moves and temporal, as documents indeterminate; “alive, liquid” (me)
o	Email has a vector
	------ 
o	term paper has a vector
	------ 
o	this vector/email has affordances (eg, archive)
o	ecosytems are different
	all the sudden, you want your email to be encrypted
	we are surrounded by vectors
	difficult to be in control of vectors; they say we do it for you
	problem/birth of idea, founding moment, we often use a proprietary format
•	whenyou wrote paper initiatially, puts you in ecosystem
•	when you’re here, you’re writing, later you want to encrypt, but because of vector you chose you no longer have that option, you’re propelled by affordnces and constraints
o	my solution is to take origin points of all those vectors (set of common problesm…access, search, sharing, back up, encryption) and because all underneath is text, there is common set of problems…want to search across all
	gmail says we’ll totalize it; don’t worry about it
o	definition of computer: machine that can emulate any other machine
	there’s a level of abstraction that floats above the software (symbolic language logic culture)
	idea of plaintext baked into unix (this file should be human readable); then there a files where are not human readable…but floating in universal human layer, which fress us from the physical confines of the universe
	how those two happen blows my mind…for us, we will stop at the hardware layer
o	plaintext, unify, easy to vectorize (send)
	plaintext vs. encrypted
	winner would say when bind to tech is equivalent to making a law
•	bridges
•	
•	weapons and encryption are militaty technology
o	qualifies as espionage
•	to encrypt something, you need to start with plaintext
•	minimal computing: think about in places where computers aren’t available/power is not a given, where accessing internet on pixalzted phone… good luck opening/reading a pdf. Pdf doesn’t reflow the text.  If you want your ideas reach African public, have to disseminate info in different format. Way I want to show you, doesn’t preclude you from using pdfs or ms word (be borne in plaintext and then ms word becomes vector of that language). Then publish it and send it places

files; can build from it
is filing system a medium? Relationship between file and media
you want medium to function as more than a file if file is something stored, piece of information
file somewhere in between … you have the universe
smaller set of universe you produce---file
get rid of noise and get to something much smaller than totality of hat patient is describing
transcribing messiness of bodily symptoms
filter—diplomatic files (author in article)

mediums accommodate different things… conceots
affordances and constraints of filters

doctors, standard files in head---dcotors not using technology, still standard filter innhead, standard story of what the patients 

file and record

ubiquitous recording

how can tech gets us ut of that

how can tech gets us out of the standard filters

amek filters more expansive and 

informatics

want school/hospital to be more than a filing system; we abnegate our responsibilities

9/29
CLARIFY DIFFERENCE
medium: air (speech), stone, paper (writing)
different from mode (modum, violin)
attunement: by changing modalities, you’re saying none of that anymore; instead of ear through pipe, recogfigure sense, medium stays same but we are changing use/modality, changing the senses, that changes culture
medium, mode, message
SAME MEDIUM, SAME MESSAGE, DIFFERENT MODES OF TRASNMISSION
Filling up channel of communication with different modality….digitality/the bit …multimodality of digital media
Why digits/encoding something with #s make something more multimodal than air? What’s being privledged?

Deposit ourselves in some sort of material artifact in order to stave off entropy and chaos..mystery of consciousness…what does it mean to know something…to be you in general. You are a blip on a razors edge of whatever is material right now to you. If we view the message as time…message moves forward in time….communication is always directed toward future which does not exist (you: the subtotal of your current material form)…how do we continue to know things/ourselves. We build ourselves a platform, which ensures continuity (along with body). …strange contract with ourselves to continue to be ourselves…ensuring integrity of self in this forrest of documents and that builds some kind of platform that ensures continuity of exi

As humans, weare concerned with the storage of information…we are concerned with some sense of unity…subscribe themselves into substratum of information

Distinguishing between written and oral in a way that I might not…you’re assuming that documents are more of a solid thing and I see docs and electronic communication as more liquid, it’s not as if we have possession when we write it down

The archive we create (modalities, media) is an extension of ourselves and is therefore going to make us as individuals and a people!!!! 

The digital is more multimodal (engage different senses)
The more capacity we have with the digital, 
The more what we create/archive can reflect the diversity of human bodies

BELL

The way we maintain unity, integrity, maintains an archive…there are various ways in which the integrity of self is 

Tenen—10/13

Information has to do w/ human freedom and human will

How to  use systems theory (actant-network, ativity theory) ---looking at artifats/objects as center  or mode of analysis (for understanding collection action/agency/will/activity)---w/o diminishing human will? It is through deliberation (Plato)


10/
minimal viable citizen website—we will post tutorials. Don’t have to be complicated

tokenizing
take each line and separate into words
sed is line based substitution
sed ‘/s/s/n/g’ moby-dick.txt
separate w/fence, do it globally
substitute woman for man globally
here saying substitute space for new line globally 

macs: brew install gnu sed –default-anme

tip: don’t hit enter at end of your word list

GIT
•	do research and keep a journal
•	everytime sit down and do something, also going to journal (keep notes on what you did)…journal is ledger of what you have done…that’s IT…that;s GIT
•	layer


tenen—lab 
•	what is a server?
•	Server is able to serve many at the same time; it is literall serving package of data
•	Streaming music online; we don’t need local information
•	Anything that needs real time continuous coverage (Wall street)
•	Dektop Also pluuged in—log into home server and serving music to yourself, [server?] renders it beautifully

Virtual server in cloud
Cloud = buy service
Server abstract entity

We’re going to use AWS (Amazon), there is also Microsoft and google
Decide how fast you want it to be and if you need to expand
With amazon can buy a tiny server and it’s elastic; it will expand and you will only pay for it if traffic increases

Server has ports coming and ports coming out – little pipes. They are numbered (8080). It’s listening for http requests and it’s going to serve html pages.  

You need storage. You need a hard drive.  S3, elastic block, glacier.
Serving from virtual architecture

AWS:
1-	learning how to manage cloud services
2-	learning to get to that cloud server

list of web services
EC2 Dashboard
•	an actual server
•	upper right: provision services by regions; US West. Etc important because one of only hints you have as to where your stuff is; the packet of info has to physically travel … don’t pick far away, pick east coast. Why it’s there: if running service like gmail, you don’t know where services ae coming from. When services come from servers in us, improves performance. It’ s important because provision …little components have to be in same region. Cost labor if don’t do this. 
•	Dashboard: limits could become important (limit pricing, bandwidth)
•	“instances’ most important
o	tenen
o	 running three server: research, control, presention
•	launch an instance 
o	(step 1: chose machine image Ami) , free free tier only –chose umbuntu?
o	Step 2: chose instance type: general purpose/free tier
o	Number of instances: 1
o	Leave all as is, step 3, enable protect
o	Tage instance: value—whatever tag you want
o	Configure security group
o	Create new security group
o	Launch
o	Create a new key pair
o	Save fuile on drive
o	Should ook like unintelligible code…. Key
o	Now you have your first baby right here!
